      <h2>Past Challenges</h2>
      <p>I've recently changed my complete future from studying medicine to studying computer science. I hope to apply the knowledge I've gained from my experiences of working within a hospital and taking many years of biology classes to my future computer science degree and occupation.</p>

        <h2>Future Challenges</h2>
        <p>I am currently planning to pursue computer science all the way through and take up a standing job offer from Samsung - United States as an intern. Ever since I had considered medicine and looked forward to applying to medical school, this has been my next biggest outlook in life. If not for Samsung, I would apply myself towards a working with a company I thoroughly enjoy, such as within the gaming industry or possibly helping family/friends with desired computer science needs. The summer of 2020 I plan to apply to a business that consists of coding, and truly begin to change my entire knowledge base from health/medical to computer science and technology. I am extremely look forward to this as well!</p>

        <h2>Current Abilities</h2>
        <p>My current abilities are very inconsistent with each other due to me being interested in various things. I attempt to know a little about everything, and this also results in having many hobbies. These hobbies include anything from mountain biking to gaming, and everything in between. My current studies consist of ~3 years of biology. This includes genetics, nutrition, microbiology, anatomy & physiology, and multiple chemistries. Within these studies, I have also ~4 years of hospital work that includes multiple years of patient care, and ~1 year of following physicians in the ER. After this Spring of 2020 school year, I can now say I know more about coding HTML and C# and hope to apply this to my future endeavors.</p>
